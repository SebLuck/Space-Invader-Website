# Space-Invader-Website
The webpage consists of a space game similar to the popular one called Space Invaders. The player has only one life and must try to survive while obtaining as many points as possible. The user earns 10 points per alien kill.  

The game is played using only three commands: the left arrow key, the right arrow key, and the "S" key on the keyboard. The "S" key allows the user to shoot, while the left and right keys move the spaceship.  

If the player ranks in the top fifty, their username and score will be displayed on the leaderboard.  

There is also a restart button that appears when the player loses. Clicking it will reload the webpage and allow the player to start the game again.  
If the player defeats a wave of aliens, another wave will appear, so the score they can achieve is unlimited.  

The player can play the game even without signing up or logging in, but their high score will not be saved. If the user is not logged in, a message in red will appear above the game telling them they are not logged in.
